So we can do authentication, but what if the next time we turn around, this feature breaks? How would we catch it? The answer is more automated tests.

So it is really fun to test things right!?

Maybe not so fun, but writing tests is a critical skill for a young engineer. At almost all companies all code must have tests that go along with it. And at many companies, young engineers are tasked with writing tests and crushing bugs for their first few weeks, so knowing how to test well will make you a very hirable and quick-to-ramp employee.

# Testing Authentication

Testing RESTful routes for a regular resource is pretty straightforward, there might be some querks but pretty much you just GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE data and check that the responses are successful. With authentication, however, testing gets a little more complicated. You have to check that JWTs are creating, that passwords are correct, and then you have to be prepared to test authorization.

The biggest challenge is tracking the cookie set by the server when a user logs in. In order to handle this cookie we can use chai's [request agent](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-http#retaining-cookies-with-each-request) functionality to track the cookie in our tests.

First create the file `test/auth.js` and we'll require the libraries we're going to need.

```js
var chai = require('chai');
var chaiHttp = require('chai-http');
var server = require('../app');
var should = chai.should();
chai.use(chaiHttp);

var agent = chai.request.agent(server);

var User = require('../models/user');

describe('User', function() {
});
```

Now we can write our first test that tests that you can't login if you haven't signed up. How would you make this test not pass, and then pass?

```js
it('should not be able to login if they have not registered', (done) => {
   agent
     .post('/login', { email: "wrong@wrong.com", password: "nope" })
     .end(function (err, res){
       res.status.should.be.equal(401);
       done();
     });

 });
```

# Testing Sign Up, Logout, and Login

Next test is to sign up. Read the following code very carefully, then add it to your project. Can you make the test red (not pass) and then green (pass)?

```js
// signup
it('should be able to signup', (done) => {
  User.findOneAndRemove({ username: "testone" }, function() {
    agent
      .post('/sign-up')
      .send({ username: "testone", password: "password" })
      .end(function (err, res) {
        console.log(res.body)
        res.should.have.status(200);
        res.should.have.cookie("nToken");
        done();
      });
  });
})
```

Next is a test logout.

```js
// login
it('should be able to logout', (done) => {
 agent
   .get('/logout')
   .end(function (err, res) {
     res.should.have.status(200);
     res.should.not.have.cookie("nToken");
     done();
   });
});
```

Finally we test login.

```js
// login
it('should be able to login', (done) => {
 agent
   .post('/login')
   .send({ email: "username", password: "password" })
   .end(function (err, res) {
     res.should.have.status(200);
     res.should.have.cookie("nToken");
     done();
   });
});
```

# Authorization in Other Tests

Now that we have authentication we're going to want to make it so some routes only work if a user is authenticated. Maybe you can only create posts if you are logged in. This means we'll have to update our tests to login before we try to create a post.

In order for the test agent to be logged in, you have to use a `before` action that mocha gives you. The `before` action runs before all the tests run.

```js
// test/posts.js

before((done) => {
  agent
    .post('/login')
    .send({ username: "testone", password: "password" })
    .end(function (err, res) {
      done();
    });
});
```

Now the agent has the JWT cookie when it makes other requests like to view the posts#new route or create a post.

This is good we have this now, because when we made it impossible to create posts when a user was not logged in broke the posts#create route test!

**Challenges**

1. Can you use this code or something like it to fix the posts#create test?
1. Can you write another test to test that it is impossible to create a post if a user is not logged in?
